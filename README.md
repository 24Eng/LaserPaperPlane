# LaserPaperPlane
This silly project uses a CNC cutting tool to create an airplane profile which features a airfoil cut out of the center. When paper is inserted into the hole, it takes the shape of the airfoil. The pieces cut out of the plane can even act as supports inside the wing.

The plane features two straight surfaces on the outside which correspond to the length paper which should be cut. The flat surface on the bottom measures a piece of paper for the wings while the flat surface at the rear measures paper for the horizontal stablizer.
